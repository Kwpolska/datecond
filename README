PURPOSE
-------

This is a minimalistic (and slightly hacky) parser for date range conditionals.

INSTALLATION
------------

::

  pip install datecond

FORMAT
------

* comma-separated clauses (AND)
* clause: attribute comparison_operator value (spaces optional)
    * attribute: year, month, day, hour, month, second, weekday, isoweekday or empty for full datetime
    * comparison_operator: == != <= >= < >
    * value: integer, 'now' or dateutil-compatible date input

API
---

The library exposes only one function:

::

   date_in_range(date_range, date, debug=True, now=None)

Where ``date_range`` is the date conditional (see `FORMAT`_ above),
``date`` is a datetime object, and ``now`` is the current date (used for 'now'
comparisons; if not specified, ``datetime.datetime.now()`` is used)

CLI USAGE
---------

::

    $ python -m datecond
    Date range to accept: year == 2016
    Date to test: 2016-01-01
        Date parsed: 2016-01-01 00:00:00
        <2016 == 2016>
        In range: True
    Date to test: 2016-02-02
        Date parsed: 2016-02-02 00:00:00
        <2016 == 2016>
        In range: True
    Date to test: 2017-01-01
        Date parsed: 2017-01-01 00:00:00
        <2017 == 2016>
        In range: False

    $ python -m datecond
    Date range to accept: year == 2016, month > 06, day >= 07
    Date to test: 2016-06-07
        Date parsed: 2016-06-07 00:00:00
        <2016 == 2016>
        <6 > 6>
        <7 >= 7>
        In range: False
    Date to test: 2016-07-07
        Date parsed: 2016-07-07 00:00:00
        <2016 == 2016>
        <7 > 6>
        <7 >= 7>
        In range: True
    Date to test: 2016-08-08
        Date parsed: 2016-08-08 00:00:00
        <2016 == 2016>
        <8 > 6>
        <8 >= 7>
        In range: True
    Date to test: 2015-07-07
        Date parsed: 2015-07-07 00:00:00
        <2015 == 2016>
        <7 > 6>
        <7 >= 7>
        In range: False
